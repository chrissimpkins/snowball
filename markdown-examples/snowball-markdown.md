# The Snowball Markdown Highlighter

This is an example of the [Markdown][1] syntax.  The file demonstrates the Markdown syntax highlighter that you are about to enjoy.  That includes things like **bold text**, _underlined text_, and `inline code` for your viewing pleasure.

Some think that we won't include any italics in this example:

> I don't think that they will include italics!
>                                  (-Some Guy)

... but they are incorrect

*Note: There **is** some italicized text [over here](https://italiclovers.com)*

## Lists

### Ordered and Unordered Lists

1. A **great link** to [MarkDown][2]
2. Another *great link* to [MarkDown](http://www.markdown.net/)
3. Or maybe just a URL like <http://www.markdown.com/>.
4. Yep, even number â…£
	* An item
	* Another item
	* Yet another item
	* And there's more...
		1. Another item
		2. Could there be more?
		3. The answer is yes

## Code blocks

#### A block of Python

``` python
def some_function(parameter, parameter):
	if (this):
		print("Aw yeah!")
	elif (that)
	   print("Oh no!")
	else:
	   print("Foo bar")
```

#### And JavaScript:

``` javascript
var test = {
  isComplete: true
};
```

#### And PHP, oh my!

``` php
function test ($var) {
  echo "string";
}
```

And sometimes you just want a bit of `$ inline code`.
